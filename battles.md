# Battles

## Steps per Round

1. ...
	1. Movement (highest Speed first)
	2. Targeting/Hitting
2. Shoot (in sequence of movement)
3. Escape to Hyperspace / surrender 

All 3 steps are done separately for all spaceships and projectiles before the next step beginns. 

## End
A battle is over when all spaceships of one fraction are destroyed or have surrendered. Until than 
the above 3 steps are repeated in an endless loop.

## Movement
- Rotation costs movement points (turning manoeuvre)
- A ship that doesn't move
	- counts as _slowing down_ in the first turn (can be hit better)
	- counts as _motionless_ in all rounds after the first as long as it doesn't move (can be hit much easier)
